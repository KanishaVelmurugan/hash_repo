## Overview

Welcome to our Plagiarism Checker project! This tool is designed to detect potential instances of plagiarism in a set of documents. It utilizes a hash value function, advanced data structures, and algorithms to efficiently compare and analyze text, providing insights into potential content matches.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI:** The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented with Tkinter for easy interaction and document selection.
- **Document Preprocessing:** Text is preprocessed to lowercase, remove punctuation, and ensure consistent formatting before analysis.
- **Hash Value Function:** The tool employs a hash value function to generate unique identifiers for document sections, facilitating efficient comparisons.
- **Plagiarism Detection:** Utilizes an algorithm to compare documents and identify potential instances of plagiarism based on a customizable similarity threshold.

## Installation

To run the Plagiarism Checker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plagiarism-checker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd plagiarism-checker`
3. Install any dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable)

## Usage

1. Run the application: `python plagiarism_checker.py`
2. Use the GUI to select the documents folder containing the files for comparison.
3. Choose a document to check against the others.
4. Receive a detailed report highlighting potential plagiarism instances.

## Algorithm

The plagiarism detection algorithm involves the following key steps:

1. **Hashing Documents:** Generate hash values for each document using a hash function.
2. **Data Structure Storage:** Store hash values in data structures for efficient retrieval.
3. **Comparison:** Analyze hash values to identify matching sections and calculate similarity scores.
4. **Reporting:** Present the user with a comprehensive report outlining potential plagiarism instances.
